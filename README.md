# Adaptive Group Testing Strategy for Infectious Diseases using Social Contact Graph Partitions

This repository contains the code for implementing an adaptive group testing strategy for controlling epidemics dynamically under certain testing capacity limitations, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The approach is based on the social contact network that divides individuals into subgraphs and assigns testing priorities adaptively based on the social contact characteristics and previous testing results.

## Requirements

To run the code, you will need:

..* Python 3.6 or higher
..* NetworkX library
..* Mesa library
..* Numpy library
..* Pandas library
..* Seaborn libaray

## Uasage

The code is provided in the form of a Jupyter notebook that can be run cell by cell directly. The notebook contains detailed explanations and comments for each step of the implementation.

## Examples

We provide several examples of simulations using the adaptive group testing strategy for different social contact networks and testing capacity scenarios. The simulation results are shown in the notebook and can be reproduced by running the corresponding cells.
